  <table style="width:100%">
            <td><p><h2>Photo Restoration</h2><p>This was my favorite project.   The goal of this project was to restore an old, creased black and white 
            photograph. I subscribed to Adobe Stock and discovered two images to use: one for the background and the 
            other as the damaged photograph itself.  Initially, I created a working copy of the photograph on a new 
            layer to preserve the original. I then cropped it to correct its skew and eliminate the damaged edges. 
            Using the spot healing brush, I removed most of the creases, and for the textured creases on the boy's shirt, 
            I employed the healing brush tool. Next, I applied the neural filter "colorize," which required me to revisit 
            and adjust some of my previous tweaks. I experimented with adjustment layers, focusing on curves and hue/saturation.
            To finish, I incorporated the background image to enhance the overall professionalism of the restoration.</p></td>
