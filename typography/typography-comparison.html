<h2>Small Claims vs. Muriel’s Restaurant Typography Comparison</h2>
<p>In this article, I will be demonstrating the importance of typography in web design by
     comparing two websites.  One shows excellent use of typography (as well as other design elements), 
     and the other is lacking in that area.  The website with excellent typography is that for Muriel’s Restaurant 
     in New Orleans.  The website that could use a makeover is the New Orleans Small Claims court website.
     We will begin with the Small Claims website, which is <a href="https://www.orleanscivildistrictcourt.org/first-city-court-clerk", "_blank"> located here.</a>
     </p>
<p>The Small Claims website is lacking in many design elements, but for the purpose of this article, 
    we will focus on its typography.  When you first arrive at its site, you see the location, 
    contact information and hours in what appears to be Times New Roman or some similar typeface, 
    centered on the screen.  The phone, the word “fax” and the title “OFFICE HOURS” are all in boldface, 
    and I cannot fathom why.  It seems quite arbitrary to me.</p>
    <img src="small-claims-home-page.png" alt="Small Claims Home Page"></a>
<p>As you scroll down, you will see the page shown below.  Again, the fonts appear to be without any 
    coherent design in mind.  It continues to be in Times New Roman, only now there are some items in blue.  
    Sometimes those blue items are hyperlinks, as you would expect, and sometimes they are not.  For 
    example, “(The information provided herein does not constitute legal advice. Each case is different. You 
    should always consult an attorney.)” is in blue but is NOT a hyperlink.</p>
    <img src="small-claims-second-page.png" alt="Small Claims Second Page"></a>
<p>As you scroll down, you see more of the same.</p>
<img src="small-claims-third-page.png" alt="Small Claims Third Page"></a></p>
<p>Finally, you reach the footer, which only states the address of the court, again in Times New Roman.  
    You might expect that a website devoted to legal matters would at least have a privacy policy listed 
    in its footer, but that's not the case.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Now, let’s go to the landing page for Muriel’s Restaurant, which is <a href="https://www.muriels.com", target="_blank">located at www.muriels.com.</a>  You immediately see the eye-catching logo, and then your eye is drawn to the sophisticated sans 
    serif font in the navigation bar. 
    <img src="muriels-home-page.png" alt="Muriels Home Page"></a>
    
    <p> If you visit “About” – “Our History”, you are brought to the site 
        shown below.  Notice the size of the title of the webpage “Our History” in a classic Serif font, 
        followed by other smaller serif headings, with the text of the paragraphs in easy-to-read Sans Serif.</p>
    <img src="muriels-our-history.png" alt="Muriels Our History"></a>
    <p>This same typography theme is consistently shown throughout the website, with the title being in that large serif 
    font, followed by the smaller headings and sans serif paragraph text.  For example, under 
    "Private Events - Jackson Square Dinner," you see the following page:</p>
    <img src="muriels-jackson-square.png" alt="Muriels Jackson Square"></a>
    <p>Notice the consistency and how the entire website gives you a sense that this is a classy, upscale restaurant with
      gourmet food.  I could gush about other aspects of this website, but that is beyond the scope of this article.  In
      any case, I will look to this site as an example of what I should aspire to be, as a web designer!</p>
